Throughout the fall semester, I attended every Carpentries workshop offered at UL. These are fanatastic foundational workshops for students and instructors who want to learn software and data skills in a fun, engaging, and manageable way. UL offers Software and Data Carpentries in R, OpenRefine, SQL, Spreadsheets, Unix Shell, Python, Docker, and Git/Github. I enjoyed these so much that I enrolled to become a certified instructor!

So, as of now, I have officially completed instructor training, which was EXCELLENT in terms of teaching motivation, pedigogy, and inclusive practices. I will complete the checkout process by Jan. 2026. I am looking forward to teaching more Carpentries workshops, including AI for GLAM, which is targerted for libraries to learn how machine learning can assist with workflows and tasks within the library.
