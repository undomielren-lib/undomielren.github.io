In Summer 2025, OU Libraries was awarded an Artificial Intelligence Seed Grant from the Data Institute for Societal Challenges (DISC). Through this initiative, the Digital Scholarship and Data Services (DSDS) team launched the OU Libraries AI Sandbox — a pilot ecosystem designed to give OU students, faculty, and researchers hands-on access to cutting-edge AI tools and infrastructure.

The AI Sandbox supports both no-code and API-based platforms, enabling you to learn, experiment with, and integrate AI into your research, teaching, and creative work. You'll have hands-on access to a range of generative and non-generative AI tools, including LibreChat, LiteLLM, HuggingFace, AWS Bedrock, and National Research Platform (NRP). We provide training materials, workshops, and three high-performance workstations to support your learning and experimentation with these AI technologies.
